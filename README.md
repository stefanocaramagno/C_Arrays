# C (Arrays)

**Hello everyone!**

My name is [Stefano Caramagno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanocaramagno), and I'm pleased to present this repository containing exercises on **arrays** implemented in **C programming**. 
These exercises were completed as part of the **Foundations of Computer Science** course during my [Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering](https://www.dieei.unict.it/corsi/l-8-inf) at the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it).

## üåç Context

This repository includes a series of exercises focused on using arrays in C programming. The exercises cover various aspects of array manipulation, providing a solid foundation for understanding how to work with fundamental data structures in C.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Array Manipulation**: Develop skills in creating, accessing, and modifying arrays in C.
- **Problem Solving**: Apply programming concepts to solve practical problems using one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.
- **Data Processing**: Learn to process and analyze data stored in arrays, including performing computations like sums and reversals.

## üìÇ Contents

- **Array Fundamentals**: Exercises on declaring, initializing, and manipulating arrays.
- **Practical Applications**: Exercises that involve operations on arrays, such as computing sums, reversing arrays, and data manipulation tasks.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Exercises that explore basic algorithm implementation using arrays.
